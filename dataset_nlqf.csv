The nurses to which the Area of Expertise applies are BIG registered. As an gastroenterologist nurse, you must have followed the advanced training to become an gastroenterologist nurse because of the high and increasing complexity of the syndromes and care questions. To be admitted to this training, one must have 1 year of work experience as a nurse in order to have sufficient demonstrable knowledge and skills in the nursing backgrounds of the disease.

The port of Rotterdam consists of several terminals. The employees and managers who follow the VCH training work at one of these terminals, namely: A container terminal A bulk terminal A tank terminal A roro (roll on roll off) terminal A general cargo terminal A rail terminal The VCH training relates to working safely and here and there on care for the environment. The tasks of the employees and managers include more than working safely, because they perform activities in the port, such as loading and unloading a ship and storing containers. The VCH training therefore covers a sub-area of their activities. The safe working sub-area mainly concerns procedures and regulations intended to reduce or eliminate risks. Employees and managers must therefore strictly comply with the rules. In addition, they are expected to be able to respond responsibly to unexpected situations. Large equipment is often used in the port of Rotterdam, such as cranes, containers, shovels, etc. Work is also carried out in ships, on the quay and in confined spaces. Safety is a top priority here. Errors in observing the safety instructions can result in injury or even death. The employees and managers are not only responsible for their own well-being, but also for that of their colleagues and others who work in the port. Communication about the work is essential. Employees and managers therefore participate in work meetings, record agreements, talk to each other and call in help from colleagues or others if necessary. The managers analyze (near) accidents and prepare documents with risk analyzes and measures. They also check for safe working practices and motivate their employees in this area. They make agreements, report, ensure follow-up and provide feedback.

The manager and employee work safely in all situations they encounter in the port. They are aware of the greatest risks of working in the port and of the risks of work experience. They are physically and psychologically in good condition and have insight into their personal limitations and their own responsibilities. They train new employees. The manager and employee work safely in accordance with regulations and procedures, rights and obligations and the code of conduct. They wear the prescribed PPE in every situation. They clean up the workplace accurately. They communicate clearly so that others see, understand and understand them. The manager and employee prepare their work in the right way. They use work permits, place barriers and carry out maintenance and repair work if necessary. They also pay attention to prevention. The manager and employee perform their work safely and in accordance with the procedures and regulations for each of the following work areas: Working at heights Ships Cranes/lifting cargo Confined space Moving/moving cargo Hot work Electricity The manager and employee handle hazardous substances with great care and avoid explosions.

It concerns (vulnerable) older clients in complex care situations that have to deal with co- and multi-morbidity. The problems are usually highly complex and unpredictable in nature. Highly complex care is understood to mean: problems in 2 or 3 domains of quality of life, referred to as (1) mental well-being, (2) physical well-being, (3) living situation and (4) social participation. Care and support questions are therefore often the result of the dysfunction of several domains of quality of life. The VGG therefore uses an integrated approach aimed at quality of life. The VGG is often in the picture for a long time, given the highly complex care situations of the clients. The VGG works within nursing, care and home care (VVT) and other sectors in care and welfare, both in primary care and secondary care and in intramural and extramural (care) settings. The VGG will often work within a multidisciplinary team, with which he/she collaborates, makes decisions and initiates appropriate interventions.

The VGG shows this by monitoring the quality and continuity of healthcare and acting in the context of exploring and analyzing the problem and guiding and treating it based on patient preferences (the client system), scientific insights and best practices (evidence based, practice based). Because suitable evidence is not always available for complex care questions, the VGG deviates from guidelines or protocols on a well-founded basis. The VGG adjusts the self-image and professional conduct based on self-reflection and feedback from others.

Ambulance care is the care that is provided professionally to provide assistance to a patient within the framework of his disorder or injury and, where necessary, to transport it adequately, with due observance of what is required on the basis of generally available medical and nursing knowledge, or to refer to another healthcare provider. Ambulance care consists of emergency and scheduled ambulance care and interpatient transport. Ambulance care is prehospital (chain) care and a primary part of the chain of acute care and part of the chain of public order and safety during large-scale events, calamities and disasters.

The ambulance nurse deals with all patient categories, of all ages and with various health problems from all medical specialties. The complexity of care is increasing due to an increase in the number of old and chronically ill patients. The complexity of care increases with the simultaneous occurrence of somatic, functional, psychological, psychiatric and social problems, with rapid changes in health status and when these problems influence each other. Because the lifespan of the Dutch population is increasing, age-related diseases will increase, as will the chance of two or more disorders or conditions occurring simultaneously in a patient (comorbidity). The increasing diversity of lifestyles (multi-culturalisation) requires specific skills to clarify requests for help, to recognize needs and to offer an appropriate range of care. psychosocial and psychiatric disorders or complaints. The ambulance nurse anticipates both low- and high-complex care questions that can be both acute and non-acute. By using a fixed methodology (triage), the ambulance nurse is able to efficiently start the diagnostic process for every patient. The ambulance nurse uses diagnostic tools for this. The patient's current condition determines the priorities and actions of the ambulance nurse. The ambulance nurse takes over the actions already initiated by other emergency services, volunteers or from a professional situation such as the fire brigade or police. In addition to carrying out the often complex care and technical care, the ambulance nurse pays ample attention to stimulating, supporting or offering compensation in the event of insufficient self-reliance in the physical and psychosocial field. As the first aid provider, the ambulance nurse often sees the patient and assesses his condition. The ambulance nurse determines the patient's care needs by means of anamnesis and examination and is able to triage and coordinate the care for the patient(s) in the event of an increased patient supply. Most actions performed by the ambulance nurse are nursing actions. In addition, the ambulance nurse performs medical procedures, a limited number of which are reserved medical procedures. Action is mainly determined by protocols and guidelines within the area of expertise. The special circumstances under which the ambulance nurse performs reserved actions do not only relate to the rapid and effective performance of life-saving reserved actions. The ambulance nurses also have specific expertise to perform certain reserved actions without the supervision or intervention of the client. The special expertise required of the ambulance nurse places high demands on the insight of the healthcare professional and on the measures to be taken that are of vital importance to the patient in emergency situations.",6

The context of this department can vary from an independent department to part of an Intensive Care Unit. Medium Care departments receive patients from the nursing ward and emergency department (step-up) as well as from an intensive care unit, operating rooms, PACU/recovery (step-down).

The MC patient is characterized by a highly complex care demand, among other things due to the wide variety of health problems. The complexity of care for the MC patient is influenced by the wide variety of clinical pictures, often with a high degree of comorbidity. This makes the course of the disease very unpredictable. Usually there is an imminent or present disturbance of one or more vital body functions, which means that the patient must be monitored very closely and intensively and vital body functions must be supported if necessary. In view of the developments, the MC will play an increasingly pivotal role in the chain of intensive care, medium care, emergency care, PACU and nursing ward. In an MC department there is increasingly intensive support of vital body functions, but endotracheal ventilation is the boundary between admission of the patient to medium care or intensive care. The revitalization of long-term ICU patients at an MC is a field that is developing rapidly. This requires very intensive physical and psychological supervision of the patient, in close collaboration with other disciplines. The medium care nurse is competent in the field of continuous intensive and accurate monitoring and support of vital bodily functions and has specific skills regarding medical-technical equipment and aids, Advanced Life Support (ALS), fundamental and applied pharmacology. The medium care nurse has knowledge and insight into the relationship between the vital functions. He shows flexible behavior by accurately anticipating the sometimes strongly changing health condition of the patient. The medium-care nurse takes the initiative when it comes to intensive rehabilitation or revitalization of the patient. The problems surrounding this growing category of patients require specific knowledge and insight into patho-physiological processes related to the difficult recovery of organ functions. Knowledge and skills in the field of restoring the patient's mobility, swallowing care, keeping the upper airway clear and caring for complicated airway problems are essential, as are other techniques and aids to help the patient recover. such as tracheostomy tubes. Patients in medium care are often seriously ill or have been very seriously ill. A specific competence of the medium care nurse lies in the field of dealing with patients, sometimes with reduced consciousness, in which, in addition to the somatic abnormalities that are still present, complex psychological, psychiatric and/or social aspects play a role. This requires the medium care nurse to have a professional attitude based on great empathy and an excellent knowledge of, for example, communication techniques. The medium-care nurse provides intensive guidance to the patient, family and relatives in the area of changes in roles and relationships as a result of physical and psychological limitations, often resulting in behavioral changes, among others in mentally incompetent patients. Based on his expertise, he consults with various disciplines involved in healthcare. This makes great demands on the coordinating capacity (directive function) of the medium care nurse. At the MC, the risk of unexpected complications with serious, if not fatal, consequences is high. The medium care nurse is able to oversee life-threatening situations in a short period of time, to interpret the clinical picture and to anticipate this quickly and professionally. The medium-care nurse is able to independently apply the correct intervention in the rapidly changing and sometimes life-threatening nature of the care demand. His expertise makes it possible to plan and carry out nursing care independently within the agreements made. The medium-care nurse regularly discusses the patient's situation and the resulting nursing action and verifies this with the attending physician. He is available for peer consultations and advises intensivists, medical specialists and/or physician assistants, based on his own nursing expertise. Powers can be granted to the medium care nurse through protocol agreements about the performance of reserved medical and high-risk actions. The medium care nurse develops within his field and profession and contributes to the expertise of himself and the professional group.",6

Candidates who do not meet the additional requirements are required by the faculty to take a preparatory examination in the relevant subject. The educational institution determines how this obligation is fulfilled. The VWO study curriculum consists of a lower form (the first three years of study) and a higher form (the last three years of study).At the end of the lower form, a profile for the upper form must be chosen. A profile consists of a coherent educational program that prepares the students for further education. There are four profiles: nature and technology nature and health economy and society culture and society The education and examination package of the vwo consists of: a common part, which is the same for all profiles a profile part, which is characteristic for the chosen profile a free part, which, depending on the chosen profile, is completed by the students with at least one subject. The final exam consists of two parts: the school exam and the central exam. The Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (OCW) determines the examination programs for the entire final examination. It states what the exam material is and how the exam material is divided between the school exam and the national exam. The profile assignment is part of the school exam. With the assignment, the student shows that he has sufficient knowledge, insight and skills that are important for the profile. The final exam includes a compulsory math test.

He can deviate from the protocols or standards in a responsible and motivated manner. Even in situations where no protocols or standards are available, he is able to choose interventions and account for himself afterwards that the tissue outside the target area is as low as possible. The radiation therapy technician chooses radiation methods ranging from more field techniques to connecting beams. He formulates an order or manufactures individual aids, so that fixation and shielding of body parts and adjustment of dose distributions and the most comfortable position of the patient are ensured. The radiation oncologist submits the whole to the radiation oncologist and the clinical physicist for verification and approval. During the implementation of the treatment plan, the radiation oncologist is responsible for the available patient information and reports on this to the radiation oncologist. The radiotherapy technician locates the tumor using appropriate radiodiagnostic equipment such as the computer tomograph and fluoroscopic equipment. The radiation oncologist carries out the treatment plan, sets the equipment with the correct parameters and radiation field and chooses the right tools. He checks, interprets and reports the radiation parameters of the individual patient. The radiation oncologist identifies deviations in the radiation planning, patient reactions and equipment and reports this to the radiation oncologist with regard to the medical aspects or to the clinical physicist with regard to the equipment and physical aspects. If a container has been fitted in the patient for this purpose, the radiation oncologist brings closed radioactive sources to the patient and removes them. The radiation oncologist takes safety measures with regard to the radiation and the general safety of patients and work processes. For an optimal and efficient course of the treatment process, it is necessary for the radiotherapy technician to be able to work together in a multidisciplinary manner within and outside the radiotherapy department.

The four learning paths offered are: the basic vocational learning path (BB) the intermediate vocational learning path (KB) the mixed learning path (GL) the theoretical learning path (TL) The basic vocational learning path prepares pupils exclusively for basic vocational training (level 2) in MBO. The senior vocational track prepares students for vocational training (level 3) and middle management training (level 4) in senior secondary vocational education. The mixed learning track and the theoretical learning track also prepare students for vocational training (level 3) and middle management training (level 4). These learning paths also offer the opportunity to move on to higher general secondary education (HAVO). There is a choice of 10 profiles within the basic vocational, senior vocational and mixed learning paths.

These are often clients with so-called risk rates. This is the big difference with the pedicurist who is not trained to treat high-risk feet and to perform specialist treatments. The medical pedicure (just like the pedicure) carries out targeted foot examinations, but also performs screenings and treats various complaints and disorders of the feet and applies relevant techniques. She has broad and specialist knowledge of relevant medical conditions and has subject-specific knowledge of materials, resources, equipment and techniques. The medical pedicure performs a number of specific treatments, which are more complex than the usual basic treatments and entail more risks. Assessing high-risk situations, preventing complications and monitoring one's own room for maneuver are the most complex aspects of the profession. The medical pedicurist often practices her profession as a self-employed person and often has her own company or practice space. Her living and working environment is therefore very recognizable to her and she has little to do or take into account others on the work floor. However, the medical pedicure (more than the pedicure) has to deal with other disciplines because the pedicure treats high-risk feet where the treatment is more complex and riskier. The medical pedicure is part of the healthcare chain and works efficiently with other healthcare providers. When detecting deviations that fall outside its limits, it will pass this on to the relevant healthcare professionals. That is why the Entrepreneurship component of the program also pays attention to personnel policy, which not only relates to dealing with personnel and/or trainees, but also broadly refers to cooperation with adjacent disciplines. The context in which the medical pedicure works can be characterized as recognizable and variable. The medical pedicure knows the limits of his own profession, makes good risk assessments and refers to other disciplines in a timely manner. She puts her client first and responds in a solution-oriented manner to the wishes, questions and complaints of the client. She works on the basis of a treatment plan. The medical pedicure adopts a service-oriented attitude. She is quality-conscious and works according to the rules in the field of hygiene and the environment. In addition, she works according to the Guidelines ""Treatment of feet of persons with diabetes mellitus and persons with a rheumatic disease"".

It recognizes risky situations and takes adequate measures to prevent risks. She meets the wishes of the client, but always keeps the feasibility in mind. She knows the limits of her professional competence and acts accordingly. She responds well to unexpected circumstances within the treatment, knows how to make the right decisions and refers a client to another discipline in a timely manner. She is enterprising. She actively follows developments in her field. The medical pedicure often works as a freelancer.

The nurse anesthetist can also be deployed for the reception and supervision of multi-trauma patients. The nurse anesthetist is part of ever-changing multidisciplinary teams.

The nurse anesthetist monitors the patient's vital signs while maintaining anesthesia; he does this on the basis of Evidence Based Practice (EBP) and agreements made with the anaesthesiologist. There is then a shift of tasks from the anesthesiologist to the nurse anesthetist. The complexity of care is determined by: the patient's state of health; the anesthetic technique used; the surgical technique or treatment performed; the setting (including place, time of treatment, composition of multidisciplinary team). During anesthesia, the complexity of care can increase in a very short time. To ensure patient safety in these situations, it is necessary that the nurse anesthetist is able to perform an analysis very quickly, make a probable diagnosis, act appropriately and call for the help of the anesthetist or others at the right time . Theoretical knowledge is integrated into the practice of, among other things, surgical technique, anatomy/physiology, pharmacology, pathology and anesthesiological care and techniques. Action is often aimed at safeguarding vital bodily functions; this requires complex skills. As a professional, the nurse anesthetist performs many different tasks within various multidisciplinary teams of medical specialists, surgical assistants and nurses. These tasks differ in content and nature and can be divided into the following three domains: Content of care; Organization of care; Professionalisation. Domain A Content of care This includes the following core tasks: Providing anesthesiological care; Observe and investigate; Analyzing and diagnosing; Patient-safe action; Communicate with the patient. The nurse anesthetist is responsible for independently performing these activities on the basis of protocols or standards of existing evidence-based practice. He/she can, if necessary, deviate from the protocols or standards in a responsible and motivated manner. Even in situations where no protocols or standards are available, he is able to choose interventions and account for the choices made afterwards. The nurse anesthetist provides information and guides the patient during the perioperative care process. He takes into account the physical, mental, cultural and social characteristics of the patient and the medication administered. The nurse anesthetist acquaints himself with relevant patient information and reports this to the anaesthesiologist. The anaesthesiologist is always present during the induction and outfeed. In addition, the nurse anesthetist assesses, based on indicated frameworks and agreements, when the expertise of the anesthesiologist should be called in. He systematically monitors, observes and records the patient's vital signs. He analyzes and interprets the data obtained, communicates about this with the other members of the surgical treatment team and, if necessary, takes corrective measures. During the absence of the anaesthesiologist, he takes independent decisions and actions within the limits of his/her knowledge and skills. The nurse anesthetist independently performs medical actions that support the operative process. Domain B Organization of care This includes the following core tasks: Ensuring the quality of the work; Taking care of organization and management; Collaborate, communicate and coordinate with other healthcare providers. To monitor and continuously improve the quality of care, the nurse anesthetist must be able to identify and analyze deficiencies in equipment and resources and take appropriate measures to improve quality. The nurse anesthetist is responsible for the availability and preparation of those resources that are necessary for the operative process, such as equipment, instruments, operating room inventory. This includes the safety check of the equipment and the responsibility for the medication double check. The nurse anesthetist recognizes the malfunctioning of equipment and instruments and takes action accordingly. In addition, the safety of the patient and the work processes are also taken care of, with the nurse anesthetist following the applicable regulations and guidelines. An optimal and efficient course of the surgical process requires that the nurse anesthetist is capable of multidisciplinary collaboration with disciplines inside and outside the operating room. Within the multidisciplinary team he has to deal with a double and sometimes triple hierarchical structure. An employer, an anesthesiologist and the patient's primary care provider. Dealing with this requires a high organizational sensitivity from the nurse anesthetist. Domain C Professionalization This includes the following core tasks: Maintaining own expertise; Coaching and teaching students and colleagues; Contributing to the development and professionalism of the profession; Participate in scientific research. The nurse anesthetist maintains his own expertise and is self-managing in this. The nurse anesthetist coaches and assesses student nurse anesthetists in becoming proficient in the field and applying the professional code. The nurse anesthetist contributes to the education of his own and other disciplines and supports the (para) medics in training who are proficient in airway management and monitoring vital functions. The nurse anesthetist contributes to professional practice through peer review. The nurse anesthetist contributes to research into the application of his field of expertise to healthcare and education. The area of work of the nurse anesthetist includes both caring for patients during operations (under general or regional anaesthesia) and (increasingly) supervising and monitoring patients in, for example, recovery and holding, delivery rooms, examination and treatment departments and pain management outpatient clinic. The nurse anesthetist can also be deployed for the reception and supervision of multi-trauma patients. The nurse anesthetist is part of ever-changing multidisciplinary teams. The training to become a nurse anesthetist is an initial training. The learner is both employee and student at the same time. After a vocational preparation period of at least 12 weeks, the student works in the teaching hospital and attends a training institute for theoretical education for a number of lesson blocks per year.",6

He focuses on the maintenance of blood circulation and the extracorporeal oxygen exchange of the blood in patients where the function of the heart is temporarily stopped in order to allow safe surgical treatment.

The special character of the position of the clinical perfusionist lies in the knowledge, skills and professional attitude regarding patients who need support or takeover of the circulation during cardio-thoracic surgery or other medical treatment. The clinical perfusionist applies this during his professional practice in heart and vascular operations with a highly technical character. The clinical perfusionist provides solicited and unsolicited advice to the cardio-thoracic surgeon on the risks and complications of the procedure based on his professional expertise. He operates advanced equipment to support and/or take over circulation and ventilation, whether or not extracorporeally, during the operation. The patient's condition can change quickly, making treatment difficult to predict. The clinical perfusionist acts proactively to prevent possible complications. In acute and life-threatening situations, the clinical perfusionist takes immediate action. In the case of long-term and routine interventions, systematic and concentrated work remains necessary to keep direct patient care optimal. In addition to these activities, the clinical perfusionist applies blood-sparing techniques in the pre-, per- or post-operative phase of cardio-thoracic or other surgical and cardiological interventions, both inside and outside the operating room complex. The clinical perfusionist carries out his work on behalf of a main practitioner under his own responsibility on the basis of established evidence-based or best practice guidelines. If necessary, he deviates from these guidelines in a responsible and motivated manner. Even in situations where no guidelines are available, he chooses interventions and accounts afterwards for the choices made. The clinical perfusionist acquaints himself with relevant patient information and ensures continuous reporting on patient information during the procedure. He determines the ECC policy and the perfusion technique, consults the treatment team preoperatively about the procedures to be followed and advises on the treatment policy, applicable systems and medical devices. The clinical perfusionist systematically monitors, observes, records and reports the patient's vital signs. He analyzes and interprets the data obtained and, if necessary, takes corrective measures. He always acts in close consultation with the main practitioner and reports his actions. He performs specific forms of extracorporeal circulation such as renal replacement therapies and selective organ perfusion technologies. He puts the patient in an optimal biochemical, haematological and physiological condition for weaning from the ECC. The clinical perfusionist provides digital documentation of the procedure followed and reports on this as part of the medical file. The clinical perfusionist is responsible for the availability and preparation of those resources and materials that are necessary for the performance of his work. The clinical perfusionist recognizes malfunctioning of advanced equipment and takes action on this. He monitors developments in the field of advanced equipment and technologies, reports on them and advises management on the purchase of advanced equipment and monitoring systems and implementation of procedures. The clinical perfusionist conducts research and participates in research projects. An optimal and efficient course of the surgical process makes it necessary for the clinical perfusionist to work together in a multidisciplinary manner, both inside and outside the operating room complex. To monitor and continuously improve the quality of care and patient safety, the clinical perfusionist identifies and analyzes defects in advanced equipment and situations that threaten the quality of care and takes appropriate measures to promote that quality.

The context of the program is laid down in a vision document. Advocacy Journalism is a specific approach within Journalism, in which the role of the journalist as a participant and contributor to the democratic process in a society or community is central. The independence of the journalist is the challenge in this, compared to other participants in this process such as action groups, PR and marketing. Due to recent developments, this journalistic role is coming to the fore again. A recent example is The Guardian's media campaign 'Keep it in the Ground'?. The AJ program and the assessment are in line with this form of journalism. In addition to theory acquisition, skills training and production also take place within the realistic environment of a Hyper Local Newsroom.

The pediatric nurse indicates and provides this guidance in palliative situations according to the investigative capacity, on the basis of evidence-based practice.

Urological care questions are the result of dysfunction of the upper and lower urinary tract and/or the male genitalia. The conditions can occur in patients of all ages and can increase with age. Continence problems are problems with urine and stool excretion. Continence problems can occur in all patients and throughout life: in newborns, children and adolescents, in adults and in the elderly, in acute care, intensive care, for example after surgery, and in chronic care. Within stoma care, the UCS nurse has been in the picture for a long time. Stoma care is not a short-term affair and is not limited to clinical intervention (bowel resection as a result of an intestinal tumour). It extends to care before, during and after admission during which the procedure (bowel resection = operation) takes place. Achieving continuity is therefore an important feature of stoma care. With the care provided by the stoma nurses, the ostomate receives the right materials and resources, and receives adequate help, guidance, information and prevention for the longer term. Ostomists occur in all care categories. However, the underlying suffering may occur in a specific stage of life or development or be related to a specific group of disorders and/or stoma patients. The UCS nurse works in primary care, secondary care (inpatient and outpatient), tertiary care, transmural and chain care or she works for suppliers of (continence) aids, such as pharmacies and medical specialist shops. In most hospitals, urology nurses work in a urology department, a multi-specialty department, or a general department. Sometimes the work on the ward is combined with work on an outpatient clinic. The urology nurse then holds independent consultation hours next to the doctor and maintains contacts with 1st and 2nd line. The urology nurse has an important role in transmural care and integrated care. This is done on the basis of partnerships around the care recipient with care providers in various fields. In the field of urological care, there is often overlap with the expertise of other professional groups and nurses with a different area of expertise, such as oncology nurses, geriatric nurses, stoma nurses or continence nurses. Proper consultation and clear agreements are necessary to ensure that the patient can choose the care provider(s) that provides optimal urological care. Most hospitals employ one or more continence nurses. They work in one or more departments and usually combine this with work in an outpatient clinic. The continence nurse holds independent consultation hours and maintains contacts with 1st, 2nd and 3rd line. The continence nurse has an important role in transmural care and integrated care. This is done on the basis of partnerships around the care recipient with care providers in various fields. The continence nurse can also work in nursing homes, institutions for the disabled and rehabilitation centres. In primary care, the continence nurse is usually complementary to general care in home care institutions, in institutions for parent and child care and in general practitioner care. However, they also work as specialist continence nurses in a number of primary care institutions. Everywhere in the first line, she is an important link in the chain of continence care, with an important advisory and indication role. Continence nurses may also be employed by suppliers of continence aids, such as pharmacies and medical specialty stores. They often have an advisory role for patients and healthcare professionals. They can also work in a self-employed construction, both intramurally and extramurally. There are continence nurses who, partly because of the complexity of the care, have specialized in a certain care category, such as children, rehabilitation, the disabled, geriatrics, the chronically ill or oncological disorders (AVVV, 2009). In the field of continence care, there is often overlap with the expertise of other professional groups and areas of expertise. Proper consultation and clear agreements are necessary to ensure that the patient can choose the care provider who provides optimal continence care. Ostomy nurses work with a diversity of players throughout the care chain, at all levels (intra-, extra- and transmural). Their role as a connecting factor in a multidisciplinary team, combined with their collegiality and involvement, ensures that the stoma patient receives the most dedicated form of stoma care. In addition, as case managers, ostomy nurses are the first point of contact for ostomates and families and, with their cooperative nature, they always ensure adequate knowledge transfer to ostomates and their loved ones. The activities therefore take place in diverse contexts with an interprofessional character. The UCS nurse 'confronts' with both current and potential nursing problems of various target groups and different age groups. The nursing problems are usually complex, unpredictable and sometimes life-threatening in nature.

The knowledge of the UCS nurse focuses on knowledge of the (dis)functioning of the upper and lower urinary tract and/or the male genitalia, knowledge of the problems with urine and stool excretion and knowledge of stoma care. Because a UCS nurse works at the intersection of the medical and healthcare domains, she thinks and works from multiple perspectives. To this end, advanced knowledge about the prevention, approach or solution of complex health issues (think of the combination of a seriously ill patient with an intestinal tumor and his/her psychological problems around the stoma in combination with mild intellectual disabilities and the lack of a supportive network) at the micro, meso and macro level is necessary. A UCS nurse has advanced and specialized knowledge of theories that form part of the body of knowledge of UCS nursing, such as epidemiology, pathology and anatomy, and knowledge of guidelines and protocols, laws and regulations, healthcare technology, advice and conversation skills, health promotion and lifestyle interventions, ethics and psychiatry and psychopathology, crisis theories and project work. From a biopsychosocial perspective and in consultation with the patient, a UCS-V will collect, analyze and diagnose data in a methodical and systematic manner in highly complex situations and on the basis of relevant methods (e.g. clinical reasoning or own strength method) and techniques. from this analysis, a UCS-V, in consultation with the patient, establishes a preliminary or potential nursing diagnosis, in which all levels of functioning have been analyzed and prioritized. A UCS-V supports the patient in setting goals and draws up a treatment plan based on shared decision making. Advice and indication are also aimed at the independent function-oriented prescription of (continence) aids, dealing with urological disorders in the various areas of life (somatic, psychological, social, sense of purpose). Depending on the care question and the context in which it takes place, a UCS-V legitimizes its own actions and accounts for the steps in the process of data collection, analysis and decision-making to itself and all (directly) involved parties. She can explain whether and which legal and moral aspects may be involved. It makes use of current guidelines and protocols and can deviate from these with substantiated reasons and records this in the reporting. The UCS Nurse coordinates complex care issues himself or in collaboration with other healthcare professionals. To this end, it focuses on strengthening the patient system and prevention at the micro-meso and macro level. A UCS-V has broad knowledge and understanding of important current developments, subjects and specialties, but also immerses himself in the developments of his own field. The level of knowledge requires a deepening and understanding of the discipline, including the scientific field. Getting to know yourself as a professional lays the foundation for further professional development. The UCS-V knows the boundaries of their own field and professional boundaries and knows when to involve other disciplines. You show an investigative attitude in the field of evidence-based practice and project-based work on quality improvement within UCS care.",6

He is part of a multidisciplinary team, consisting of surgical specialists, anesthesiologists, nurse anesthetists and surgical assistants. The surgical assistant assists the treating specialist in his work and coordinates and directs the patient care process during the perioperative period. In addition, the surgical assistant works together with the support services of the operating department, such as the central sterilization department, the nursing departments, the radiology department and laboratories. The surgical assistant training is an initial training. The learner is both employee and student at the same time.

The surgical assistant has core tasks in three domains. The description of the learning outcomes uses the CanMEDS1 model for this purpose, which is based on the same principles: Care (CanMEDS 1-5), Organization (CanMED 6), Profession (CanMED 7) Care The surgical assistant has an assistant during the surgical procedure task, an instrumenting task or a bypass function (task) and a coordinating task. Specific support actions take place within each of these tasks. Actions are performed and decisions are taken both independently and on behalf of the specialist, including reserved, risky and surgical actions. The patient's condition can change quickly, making treatment difficult to predict. Immediate action must be taken in acute and life-threatening situations. With long-term and routine interventions, systematic and concentrated work remains necessary. Communication and collaboration with the members of the multidisciplinary team are essential. The surgical assistant communicates purposefully on the basis of situations that apply in the context and professional practice with peers, specialists and non-specialists, managers and patients. The quality of the care provided must also go hand in hand with careful treatment and good information provision to the patient, his relatives and any supervisors. Each operation places high demands on the management and availability of medical devices. This is the responsibility of the operating assistant. Medical devices are understood to mean: rooms, equipment, instruments, disposable materials, medicines, implants and knowledge and information systems. Inadequacies in logistics, technology and operation can have major consequences for the treatment of the patient. The surgical assistant is responsible for preventing unintentional retention of instruments, gauzes, disposables and suture needles. Organization The surgical assistant is part of a multidisciplinary surgical team that, in addition to two or three surgical assistants, also consists of a nurse anesthetist, one or more surgeons and an anaesthetist. Often other disciplines are also involved in the care, such as a radiological laboratory technician, medical technician, EEG laboratory technician, perfusionist and transplant coordinator. In addition, the surgical assistant works together with the support services of the operating department, such as the central sterilization department, the nursing departments, the radiology department and laboratories. Six components are important for effective teamwork: situational awareness, problem identification, decision making, workload distribution, time management and conflict resolution. The surgical assistant promotes cooperation and training in the broadest sense of the word in the role of coach and/or participant in intervision or training activities. The operating assistant supervises students, trainees and other professionals, whether or not in training. He acts as a role model, gives instructions on how they should fulfill their role both internally and externally and answers questions. To monitor and continuously improve quality, the operating assistant is able to identify and analyze defects and take appropriate measures. Patient safety and acting in the spirit of it is common practice. He also has a duty to report calamities.",6
